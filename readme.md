rp: This stands for Relying Party, which represents the website or application that is relying on WebAuthn for authentication. It contains the following subkeys:

name: The name of the relying party (website or app).
id: An identifier for the relying party, often the hostname of the website.
icon: An icon or image associated with the relying party.
user: This represents the user account that will be associated with the WebAuthn credential. It contains the following subkey:

id: The user identifier encoded as a Buffer. The data field contains a sequence of bytes representing the user's unique ID.
challenge: A challenge provided by the server (relying party) to the client (user agent) during the credential creation process. It is used to prevent replay attacks and is also encoded as a Buffer.

pubKeyCredParams: An array of public key credential parameters, specifying the cryptographic algorithms and key types supported for credential creation. In this example, it contains two entries with types "public-key" and corresponding alg values -7 and -257.

timeout: The time allowed for the user to complete the credential creation process, specified in milliseconds.

attestation: Specifies the type of attestation requested. In this case, it is set to "none", indicating that no attestation is required for the authenticator (security key or device) that creates the credential.

authenticatorSelectionCriteria: This specifies the criteria for authenticator selection during the credential creation process. It contains the following subkeys:

attachment: The preferred authenticator attachment, set to "platform" in this case, which prioritizes platform authenticators like fingerprint sensors.
requireResidentKey: A boolean value indicating whether the authenticator should support resident credentials (credentials stored on the device).
userVerification: The preferred level of user verification required during credential creation, set to "required" in this example.
authenticatorSelection: Another way to specify the authenticator attachment, set to "platform" in this case, like in the authenticatorSelectionCriteria.
